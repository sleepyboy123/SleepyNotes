A wiki theme for markdown driven documentation sites using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/).

## Motivation

I wanted a gatsby driven documentation platform that is dead-simple to contribute to (provided that you know how to use git and markdown üò¨).

This project is primarily developer focused but it is open to contributions and suggestions from anyone who wants to use a gatsby-powered documentation site!
